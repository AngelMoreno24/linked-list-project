To use the make file type "make". This will compile the files and make an executable file called output

If make was already used it will say 'output' is up to date if no changes were made to the file

The make file will create .o files when a change is made in any of the fils

to delete the .o files, type "make clean"

to use the exexutable file produced, type "./output"
